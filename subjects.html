            Towards the end of 3rd year I picked the subjects that I'd do for TY. 
            This was an important decision and it shaped my year. We had to do maths, English, Irish and a foreign language by default. 
            We also had to choose our extended core subjects which involved choices of different businesses and sciences. 
            Lastly, we had to choose our optional subjects, which were completely different to anything we'd done before. 
            <p></p>
            I continued doing French from my Junior Certificate cycle and I really improved throughout the year. 
            Taking part in the French exchange really strengthened my vocabulary and confidence in speaking. 
            We will be doing the DELF (Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française) exam at the end of the year. 
            It's a standardised French exam which is awarded by the French government and is recognised in all French-speaking countries. 
            <p></p>
            In maths, we've learnt lots of new topics and expanded on what we learnt before. 
            We mostly stayed away from the Leaving Cert course but thanks to Mr Reeves we finished the TY course early and started on complex numbers that we're supposed to do in 5th year.  
            <p></p>
            Our extended core consisted of four different subjects during the year, with two per week before Christmas and two different ones after Christmas. 
            I chose to do Physics, Accounting, History and Economics. This gave me a wide variety of subjects and topics to learn about. 
            In the first term I did Physics on Tuesdays and accounting on Thursdays.

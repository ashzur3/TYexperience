        I loved physics class as we talked about interesting topics like space, radioactivity and drug use in sport. 
        Cosmology is the study of everything extraterrestrial. 
        I love stories and theories about life in space and interstellar travel. 
        We had class discussions about planets, stars and aliens. 
        Radioactivity was also interesting as we learned about nuclear bombs, radiation poisoning and fallout. 
        We discussed the usefulness of radiation and chemo therapy in cancer treatment and the upsides and downsides of nuclear power. 
        Lastly, we were taught about performance enhancing drugs and blood doping to enhance athletic prowess. 
        It's a huge issue in sports today and drugs are always hard to test for.
        <p></p>
        I enjoyed accounting class and found it quite easy. 
        I'm planning on doing it for my Leaving Cert and I'm hoping to do well in it. 
        It involves quite a lot of maths but it's all fairly simple. 
        Once you learn the basics it's just a matter of using the formulas correctly in the test. 
        Ms Clancy was a good teacher and definitely encouraged me to continue doing it. 
        I didn't do Business in the Junior Cert, but it was easy enough to pick up as the course is different. 
        <p></p>
        In the second term I did History and Economics. 
        I really liked History in the Junior Cert and I think it's great to know about. 
        After all, you need to learn from the past to avoid repeating it. 
        I ended up missing quite a lot of the course due to doing extra work experience and going away on the French exchange. 
        However, I definitely enjoyed the second half of the course. 
        We were mostly learning about foreign wars America fought, like in Vietnam and Korea. 
        Their goal was to protect people and stop the spread of communism, but they ended up doing more harm than good. 
        We watched a few historical movies about war and dictators; which we discussed afterwards.
        <p></p> 
        Economics was the last subject I chose, and it was probably the one I enjoyed the least. 
        It's quite interesting at the start to learn about how the economy works. 
        I enjoyed learning about supply and demand as it's helpful in the real world. 
        However, it gets quite repetitive and there's not much variation in the different economic formulae.

        Every Friday we had a different PE or Outward Bound activity. 
        This was also split into two sections during the year, with all the PE activities in the first term. 
        These included tennis, golf, Jumpzone, gym and general PE. 
        Tennis was done in WestWood in Leopardstown. 
        It was good to do because I hadn't played tennis since primary school and I somehwo still remembered the basics. 
        I really liked golf because it was easier than I was expecting. 
        I took my first swing ever and managed to hit a huge stroke right down to the end of the driving range. 
        I had done mini golf before and I play a lot of hockey so I'd already have a solid grounding but it thought it was impressive nonetheless. 
        <p></p>
        We took a bus to Jumpzone in Sandyford Industrial Centre. 
        I'd never done it before, but I had a good time. 
        There was a big section with loads of trampolines where you could run across or do flips and tricks on. 
        There were also dodgeball arenas and foam pits to jump into. 
        My favourite part was a narrow beam over a foam pit where you'd try to knock someone else off with a long pole. 
        <p></p>
        The gym section of PE was very similar to my circuit training class. 
        We did different circuits and exercises to improve strength and cardio. 
        General PE was the only section similar to PE in the three years previous. 
        We played different sports like badminton, football, handball and hockey. 
        <p></p>
        In the second half of the year we did Outward Bound activities. 
        These involved leaving the school to go further away and do unusual sports and activities. 
        We did rock climbing both indoors in Sandyford and outdoors in Dalkey quarry. 
        We also did a few different walks in the hills around Dublin. 
        We trekked over the Sugarloaf in thick fog when we could hardly see 10 metres ahead. 
        I think we were pretty lucky to make it back at all. 
        <p></p>
        We also went orienteering in Killiney Hill park. 
        Flags were hidden all over the park and we were given a map to try and find them. 
        There was a stamp at each flag and we had to collect all the stamps as fast as possible. 
        The last activity we did was kayaking in Dun Laoghaire harbour. 
        We went to the INSS and got wetsuits and buoyancy aids. 
        Then we got a powerboat out to some kayaks and each got one. 
        We paddled around the harbour and jumped in the water.

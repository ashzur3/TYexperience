        My Transition Year was amazing, and I'd love to do it all over again if I could. 
        I tried to take part in everything that interested me at all and that meant I was constantly busy. 
        Anyone who claims that TY is a relaxing year would be wrong. 
        However, it's tiring in more interesting ways than other years, as there's less focus on work and study and more on different and new experiences.
        I learnt lots about the working world and new subjects I would've never thought to try.
        <p></p>
        I did lots of cool activities during Transition Year, including charity work, sports, trips abroad, work experience and interesting classes. 
        A few highlights would be: the French exchange, the ski trip in Italy and doing work experience where my dad works. 
        I'll explore all the things I did in detail throughout this project.

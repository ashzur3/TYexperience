            I have done 3 different work experience placements at the time of writing this project and I plan to do two more before the end of the year. 
            I worked in the Young Scientist Exhibition, Oath Technologies and 8a restaurant. 
            I'm going to work in PAC architecture studio and the Brabazon nursing home.  
            <p></p>
            My first placement was in the BTYSTE (BT Young Scientist and Technologist Exhibition). 
            My mum works for BT and they sponsor the event. 
            The BT employees always run it and organise everything behind the scenes. 
            My mum has done it for the past few years and said it's always been great. 
            They have a specific program for TY students and they get some in to help out every year. 
            We were in from Monday to Saturday making sure everything ran smoothly. 
            There was 17 of us from all over the country working there so it was a great chance to meet new people. 
            I made friends there that I'm still in contact with. 
            Before the students arrived we had to move a lot of things around and pack bags for a long time. 
            There were over 1000 students suppsed to be coming so we had to pack over 1000 bags with sponsored items. 
            We then set up near the front desk and would direct people past to get one after they had registered and set up their presentations. 
            Once the public and schools were coming in, we were helping out by directing people around and making announcements. 
            I was working on the front desk for a while, registering students and teachers and giving information to people. 
            I had to deal with complaints, requests and a lot of questions. 
            It really helped me understand how events like that would be run. 
            <p></p>
            My second work placement was at Oath Technologies, where my dad works. 
            It's a blanket company owned by Verizon that encompasses AOL, Yahoo and many other tech companies like Engadget and Tumblr. 
            Myself and my friend Declan were working there for a week. We were put on a team of programmers and a few interns. 
            We worked most closely with an intern called Glen. He helped teach us about coding and website design. 
            We learned many different programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and PUG. 
            Our goal was to design a website about ourselves with an integrated database. 
            We also used cookies to hold previously entered info, making people able to sign up and log in to our website. 
            I really enjoyed working here and not just because of the work. 
            The food was amazing too. 
            They have a canteen catered by KC Peaches and there's free food in small kitchens of every floor too. 
            You could always get soft drinks, bars or hot drinks throughout the day. 
            On top of that, there was an ice cream machine and lots of toppings to choose from. 
            There was also a games area with a pool table, foosball and table tennis. 
            <p></p>
            I worked at 8a Restaurant in Monkstown during the week with lots of snow. 
            Unfortunately, this meant it was closed on Wednesday and Thursday, but I ended up coming back to work Saturday and Sunday instead. 
            My parents know the owners of the restaurant well, so we were able to arrange for a placement there without any trouble. 
            It was quiet in the restaurant during the week but by the weekend it had gone back to being busy again. 
            My experience there lead to being offered a job, which is amazing. 
            I'm now working there occasionally and getting paid reasonably. 
            I usually work behind the bar but I also take orders and serve food to customers.

            On top of our other subjects, we had to pick 4 optional subjects from different categories. 
            These were very different to classes we'd done before and could range from salsa dancing and yoga to web design and philosophy. 
            These were usually some of my favourite classes of the week as they're less academic and more fun. 
            <p></p>
            On Monday afternoons I did circuit training in the gym. 
            Ms Wallace taught us about different lifts, accessories and exercises.
            After going over how to use all the equipment we got a program to follow. 
            This involved a lift like bench, squat or deadlift to start the day, then usually accessories like curls, pull ups or sit ups. 
            We usually ended the session with a cardio workout like using the rowing machine, treadmill or assault bike.

            On Tuesday mornings I did architecture. 
            This class was really fun and also it interested me as I'm considering a career in architecture. 
            We learned about different styles of building and architecture and how they'd evolves over the years. 
            We went on a few trips outside of the classroom to view different buildings around the area. 
            We went to Dun Laoghaire to look at the new library, the town hall and the old church. 
            We also spent a long time planning and designing changes we'd like to make to the school, which we were told might have actually influenced the new plans for the school. 
            Lastly, we made models of apartments and tower blocks out of paper and cardboard.

            Web design on Wednesdays had become my favourite class of the week by the end of the year. 
            I've always had an interest in computers and technology.  
            Only recently did I start getting into coding and creating web pages though. 
            I did a work experience placement in Oath Technologies, where my dad works and I learnt a lot about coding in that week. 
            This really helped me in web design as I had an advantage by already knowing the basics. 
            We started by designing simple websites using HTML and styling them with CSS. 
            We then created databases to hold information we could input to them and display it on our website. 
            We used p5.js, a JavaScript library to create an interactive bouncing pacman game, which you can try out <a href="pacman.html">here</a>
            <p></p>
            On Thursdays I did CAD (computer-aided design). 
            It's a class very similar to Technical Graphics in the Junior Cert. 
            Tech G was one of my favourite classes and I did well in it, so I felt this was the next step. 
            While Tech G is all mostly on paper, CAD is all on computers, using a program called SolidWorks to design whatever we wanted. 
            I designed many items, mostly mechanical, like gaming controllers, firearms and phones.
